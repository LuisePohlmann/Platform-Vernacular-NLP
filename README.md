# Platform-Vernacular-NLP

This repository serves as the appendix to my bachelor thesis titled "Topics, Registers, and Syntax â€“ A Natural Language Processing Comparison of Platform Vernaculars of News on Instagram and X."

The Instagram data was downloaded using the Instaloader (https://instaloader.github.io/), the X data using TWExportly (https://100xtools.com/twexportly). The code for the distinction of main and subclauses was provided by Jonathan Scholbach (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64055526/extract-main-and-subclauses-from-german-sentence-with-spacy), and the OCR uses the library pytesseract (https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/Tesseract_Dokumentation/blob/main/Tesseract_Doku_Windows.md). The liscenses for the specific code parts are detailed in the code. All other code was written by me and can be used according to the liscense in this repository.
